# @small-tech/remote

A little class for messaging with sockets.

## Usage

```js
import Remote from '@small-tech/remote'

// e.g., In the browser (you can also use it in Node)
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://my.socket/')
const remote = new Remote(socket)

// Handle messages of type my.fancy.response
remote.my.fancy.response = message => {
  console.log('I got a fancy response', message)
}

// Handle messages of type my.fancy.progress
remote.my.fancy.progress = message => {
  console.log('Progress: ', message.progress)
}

// Send a message of type my.fancy.request
remote.my.fancy.request({
  please: true
})
```

Messages are sent as JSON strings and received messages are parsed from JSON strings.

Youâ€™ll see warnings about unhandled messages, if any, in the console.

__Note:__ `request` is a special method used when sending a message. It is also included in the name of the message. However, `progress` and `response` are not special terms. You can name the leaf node of a message name anything you want.

## Test

```shell
npm run test
```

Note: the tests use `EventTarget` and require Node 16. The module itself should work on Node LTS (14.x as of this writing) and browsers.

## Coverage

```shell
npm run coverage
```
